# My Python Projects

Here are some of my personal projects made using Python. Hope they'll prove useful to some of you. Cheers!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Copy of Windows (32-bit/64-bit)
* Python 3.x installed
* Each project depends on their own set of libraries. Make note of the imports and use pip to install the appropriate functions

## List of Scripts

### <a href="https://github.com/need4swede/Powershell-Scripts/tree/main/Filename%20Manager">' Halo Infinite Backup Utility '</a>

* Halo Infinite (as of 12/2021) has a glitch that can delete your campaign data. This tool creates local backups
* Backup Function prompts user to browse for Halo Infinite SystemAppData within the user's appdata directory and then to select a backup destination
* Once the initial destination is set, this information is stored and all subsequent uses of "Backup" will automatically generate a new backup to aforementioned location
* Backups are saved as "savegame" with a numeric suffix to designate version
* Restore function prompts user to load a savegame from their backup location and restores it to their Halo Infinite SystemAppData directory
